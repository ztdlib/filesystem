Low level file editing made easier.

#### Info
New open souce version of the legacy fileOperator (private repository, not available).

Also, this code has been writter by a couple of students, please don't hate on us if the code is not perfect `>.<'` , but feel free to open an issue for any error, possible optimization, code style enhancement or bug!
And yes, we know that ifstream already exists! But this is more for fun than actual use.
